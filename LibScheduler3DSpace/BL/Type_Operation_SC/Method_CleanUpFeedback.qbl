Method CleanUpFeedback
{
  Description:
  [*
    3DSpace specific, cleans up feedback data of this operation before itself gets deleted. 
    This is in conflict with standard Scheduler behavior where operations cannot be deleted until all planning data are deleted.
    Feedback data are also usually cleaned up after some period, not manually like we need to here for 3DSpace.
  *]
  TextBody:
  [*
    // Only removing SingleTask feedback
    // When BatchTask are supported in the future, we can add removal of BatchTask feedback here
    traverse( this, OperationTaskFeedback.FeedbackTaskInSchedule, feedback )
    {  
      feedback.Remove();
    }
  *]
}
