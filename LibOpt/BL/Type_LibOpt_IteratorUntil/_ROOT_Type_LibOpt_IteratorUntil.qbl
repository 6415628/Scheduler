  Description:
  [*
    The `LibOpt_IteratorUntil` is a `LibOpt_Component` that repeats the `LibOpt_Task` it receives to the `LibOpt_Component` linked to it multiple times.
    The `LibOpt_IteratorUntil` continues repeating the `LibOpt_Task` until its `LibOpt_Task` is aborted or the `LibOpt_StopCriterion` triggers.
    Repeating a `LibOpt_Task` means that a new `LibOpt_Task` will be created with the same `LibOpt_Scope` as the `LibOpt_Task` that is being repeated.
    
    The `LibOpt_IteratorUntil` will continue repeating the `LibOpt_Task` concurrently. This means that while the `LibOpt_IteratorUntil` starts one iteration, the `LibOpt_IteratorUntil` can start another even though the first is not yet finished.
    The setting `MaxParallel` will determine the maximum number of iterations that the `LibOpt_IteratorUntil` can have running concurrently.
