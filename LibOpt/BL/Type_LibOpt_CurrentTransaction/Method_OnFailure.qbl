Method OnFailure (QuillError e)
{
  Description:
  [*
    This method is called from the `onfailure` part of a `try{...}onerror{...}onfailure{...}` block. 
    We are no longer in a safe `try{...}` block, so `EndSafeTransaction` resets the `TransactionGUID` attribute. This ensures that the `IsSafe` method will return `false` when it is called.
    This method also calls the `HandleQuillErrorFromOnFailure` method. The `HandleQuillErrorFromOnFailure` method eventually throws an error.
    However, before the error is thrown, many objects are serialized. This ensures, for example, that we do not lose the `LibOpt_Snapshots` that were created in the current transaction.
