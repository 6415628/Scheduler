MethodOverride IsDatasetCopyOnContinueAllowed () remote as Boolean
{
  Description:
  [*
    When a `LibOpt_Iterator` creates a dataset copy on the 'Continue' component position, then also a replannable snapshot is created.
    These replannable snapshots would be visible from all iterations that are created by the iterator. This makes the 'Snapshots' form hard to interpret, so we disallow this.
