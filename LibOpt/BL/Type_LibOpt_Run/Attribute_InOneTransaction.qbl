  Description:
  [*
    When this setting is set to `true`, the `LibOpt_Run.Start` method will not use reactive quill, meaning the optimization run will be done in one transaction.
    If a component creates a new stream, while this setting is set to `true`, the run will probably crash. Be careful.
    
    Note that you will need to make sure that the components are also executing in the same transaction.
    For example, you can use the `LibOpt_TaskTransporterOneTransaction`.
    You can set the `LibOpt_TaskTransporterOneTransaction` on your `LibOpt_Links` by using the `LibOpt_Link.SetTaskTransporterOneTransaction` or the `LibOpt_Link.AsOneTransaction` methods.
    The `LibOpt_Run.ConfigureForOneTransaction` static method helps you transform your `LibOpt_Run` to be executed in one transaction.
