  Description:
  [*
    When the 'Create dataset copy' button in the 'Component positions' form is pressed, then this attribute is set to `true`.
    This button can only be pressed when the run is paused.
    As long as the run is paused, the `PollBreakpoints` method is executed every `LibOpt_Run.BreakpointPollDuration` seconds. 
    When this `HasToCreateDatasetOnBreakpoint` attribute is `true`, then the `PollBreakpoints` method will create a dataset copy. 
    This method will then automatically set the `HasToCreateDatasetOnBreakpoint` attribute to `false`.
