Method CopyAndStart (LibOpt_Component start_component, LibOpt_ScopeElements scope_elements) as LibOpt_Run
{
  Description:
  [*
    This method copies the `LibOpt_Run`, but allows a different start component and start scope.
    It also starts the run. This method exists to make sure we only have one transaction of creating and starting the run.

  TextBody:
  [*
    run := this.Copy( start_component, scope_elements );
    run.Start();
    
    return run;
