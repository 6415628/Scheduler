  Description:
  [*
    The status of the `LibOpt_Run`.
    We define these statuses:
     - Loaded - The `LibOpt_Run` has not started optimizing.
     - Optimizing - The `LibOpt_Run` started optimizing and is currently working.
     - Finished - The `LibOpt_Run` has finished optimizing.
     - Aborted - The `LibOpt_Run` has been aborted.
     - Aborted - Copied dataset - The `LibOpt_Run` has been aborted, because this dataset is a copy of the dataset in which the run started.
     - Failed - The `LibOpt_Run` has failed. An error was not caught.
     - Paused - The `LibOpt_Run` has been paused by a `LibOpt_BreakpointEvent`.
     
    The static methods representing these statuses can be found on `LibOpt_RunStatus`.
