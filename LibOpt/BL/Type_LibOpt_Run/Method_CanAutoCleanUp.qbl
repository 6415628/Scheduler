Method CanAutoCleanUp () const remote as Boolean
{
  Description:
  [*
    Return whether the current run is allowed to be cleaned up or not.
    By default this method does not exclude runs with `AutoCleanupEnabled` = `false`, as this will be handled in the `LibOpt_Optimizer.GetRunsForCleanup`.
    See the implementation of `LibOpt_Optimizer.GetRunsForCleanup` for more information.
    
    This method can be extended to exclude more runs.
