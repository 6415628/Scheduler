Method AddUnsafe (LibOpt_ScopeThin scope) as LibOpt_ScopeShared
{
  Description:
  [*
    Adds the given `LibOpt_ScopeThin` to the `LibOpt_ScopeShared`. This either happens by actually adding it to the `LibOpt_ScopeShared`, or creating a new one and removing this one.
    Therefore we also return a `LibOpt_ScopeShared`; this is the (new) `LibOpt_ScopeShared` that will be used.
    
    It is unsafe, as we're not checking if there exists the `LibOpt_ScopeShared` we may create already exists. If it does, an error is thrown. If you need to check, use the `Add` method.
