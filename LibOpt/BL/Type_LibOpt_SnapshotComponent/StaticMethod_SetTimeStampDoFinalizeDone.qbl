StaticMethod SetTimeStampDoFinalizeDone (LibOpt_SnapshotComponent snapshot, LibOpt_Run run)
{
  Description:
  [*
    Set the `PrecisionTimeStampDoFinalizeDone` attribute.
    This method should be called after all 'Finalize' methods of the `LibOpt_SnapshotComponent.Task` have been executed. This includes `LibOpt_Component.OnFinalize`, which is called when a `LibOpt_Task` is deleted.
    This method is also called by the `LibOpt_Task.HandleExceptionFinalize` method, to ensure that the execution time of the finalize part of a component is also correct after an exception.

    // It shouldn't be possible that the PrecisionTimeStampDoFinalize attribute is not yet set. 
    // However, this method can also be called by HandleExceptionFinalize right after an exception occurs.
    // Therefore, it doesn't hurt to do check this anyway.
