Method RequireFinalizedSubtasks () as Boolean
{
  Description:
  [*
    Returns whether the subtasks of this `LibOpt_Component` need to be finalized before returning.
    
    If this returns true, we guarantee that for all the `LibOpt_Tasks` that are completed, the `OnFinalize` is executed.
    By default this is false, to reduce the number of transactions necessary.
  *]
  TextBody: 'return false;'
