    //Check the snapshotcomponent of the current task
    snapshot := task.SnapshotComponent();
    
    //Check if this is a leaf
    //Please note this method is very similar to LibOpt_SnapshotComponent::CheckNeedsIterationThread and should be aligned with that one
    //Only reason for not directly aligning it is that it is on different objects, and therefore hard to keep the code exactly the same
    return not isnull( snapshot ) and isnull( link );
