  Description:
  [*
    The position in the sequence of the `LibOpt_Components` in the `LibOpt_Run`.
    
    The `LibOpt_Components` are sorted according to the `Path`.
    This is slightly different from sorting on the `Depth`.
    
    The difference is that the `Path` keeps different branches in a `LibOpt_Switch` together, while sorting on `Depth` intertwines them.
    
    Example:
    
    If we have a switch with 2 branches, A and C, with each a link to B and D respectively, the sorting order is different.
    
     switch -> A -> B
     switch -> C -> D
     
    Now the `Depth` (and the sorting on `Depth`) will be:
    switch = 0
    A = 1
    C = 1
    B = 2
    D = 2
    
    The `Path` (and sorting of the `Path`) will be:
    switch = "switch"
    A = "switch" -> "A"
    B = "switch" -> "A" -> "B"
    C = "switch" -> "C"
    D = "switch" -> "C" -> "D"
