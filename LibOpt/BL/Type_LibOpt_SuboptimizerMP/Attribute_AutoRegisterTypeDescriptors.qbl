  Description:
  [*
    Whether the suboptimizer should call the `RegisterTypeDescriptors` method automatically or not.
    
    When this is enabled and the suboptimizer is not running in one transaction (with `InOneTransaction` is `false`) an additional transaction with a read-write lock on the dataset will be created to register the type descriptors.
    If the suboptimizer is executed in parallel with some other transactions, this may slow down the suboptimizer.
    If this is the case, one should set this attribute to `false` and manually register the type descriptors in the `Initialize` and/or `InitializeReactive` methods.
