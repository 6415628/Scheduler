  Description:
  [*
    A string that represents the object/aspect this statistic focuses on when collecting its values. It does not have to be unique as the relevant object/aspect could have multiple statistics.
    
    For example, a `LibOpt_StatisticSuboptimizerMPInfeasible` statistic and a `LibOpt_StatisticSuboptimizerMPKappa` statistic can have the same `Focus` value of "MIP Subopt, Execution 2".
    This means they both collect values about:
    - the `LibOpt_Component` (`LibOpt_SuboptimizerMP` in particular) with `LibOpt_SuboptimizerMP.Name` of "MIP Subopt", and
    - the 2nd MP execution of said MP suboptimizer.
    
    The difference is that the former statistic focuses on infeasibility, while the latter statistic focuses on Kappa values.
    See the `LibOpt_Statistic.Type` attribute for more details about this.
