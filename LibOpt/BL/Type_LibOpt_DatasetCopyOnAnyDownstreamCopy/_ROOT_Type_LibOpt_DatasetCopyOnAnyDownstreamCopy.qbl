  Description:
  [*
    The dataset will be copied when the optimizer reaches this component position. This dataset copy will be deleted when all downstream dataset copies have been deleted (or when no downstream dataset copies exist). 
    Dataset copies count as 'downstream' when the dataset is copied on any downstream component or when the dataset is copied on this component after the `LibOpt_DatasetCopyOnAnyDownstreamCopy` dataset copy is created.  
    In particular, dataset copies that are attached to any upstream 'Finalize' `LibOpt_BreakpointPositions` are not downstream dataset copies of the `LibOpt_DatasetCopyOnAnyDownstreamCopy` dataset copy, even though these dataset copies are created after the `LibOpt_DatasetCopyOnAnyDownstreamCopy` dataset copy is created.
    Also, when a `LibOpt_DatasetCopyOnAnyDownstreamCopy` dataset copy is attached to the 'Continue' `LibOpt_BreakpointPosition`, then a dataset copy that is attached to the 'Initialize' `LibOpt_BreakpointPosition` of that component is not a downstream dataset copy.
    
    Please don't subclass this type. This will break the unit tests.
