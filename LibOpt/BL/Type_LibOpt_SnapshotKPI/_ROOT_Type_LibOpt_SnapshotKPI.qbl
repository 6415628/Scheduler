  Description:
  [*
    This is a `LibOpt_Snapshot` used to store information from the `LibOpt_RollbackKPI`.
    We expect different instances for the initial KPIs and the post handle result KPIs.
    
    We expect this type to be subclassed if additional KPIs are to be stored as well.
    For example, to also store the total cost, the total virtual cost, the total unplanned cost etc.
    Note there is a standard implementation called `LibOpt_SnapshotKPIDefault` which stores only the `RollbackKPI` in case no other KPIs need to be stored.
