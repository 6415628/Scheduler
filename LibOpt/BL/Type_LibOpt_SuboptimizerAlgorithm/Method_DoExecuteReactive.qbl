Method DoExecuteReactive (stream[Algorithm] algorithm, LibOpt_Task task) as stream[JSON]
{
  Description:
  [*
    Solve the algorithm in the stream.
    
    The default implementation of this method creates one additional transaction.
    
    To be overridden in the "LibOpt" library, when creating a new base suboptimizer type for a new solver type.
    We highly recommend to override this method to remove the additional transaction from the default implementation. Removing a transaction gives a (small) speed improvement.
