Method DoExecute (Algorithm algorithm, LibOpt_Task task) as stream[JSON]
{
  Description:
  [*
    Solve the algorithm in the current transaction.
    
    To be overridden in the "LibOpt" library, when creating a new base suboptimizer type for a new solver type.
    The override should respect the `InOneTransaction` attribute:
    - If `true`, it should
    	- execute the solver
    	- call `DoHandleResult`
    - If `false` it should
    	- execute `DoExecuteReactive` in the same transaction.
    	
    This method should only be overridden in the `LibOpt` library.
