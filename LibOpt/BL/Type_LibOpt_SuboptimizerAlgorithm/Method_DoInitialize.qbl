Method DoInitialize (LibOpt_Task task) as owning Algorithm
{
  Description:
  [*
    Call the `Initialize` method for your specific suboptimizer.
    The `Initialize` should initialize the specific algorithm within the current transaction.
    
    To be overridden in the "LibOpt" library, when creating a new base suboptimizer type for a new solver type.
  *]
  IsAbstract: true
  TextBody:
  [*
    // To be overridden.
    // - Ideally, you would introduce an `Initialize` method on the subclass of the suboptimizer, which returns
    //   the specific Algorithm type.
    // - For example, for the `LibOpt_SuboptimizerMP` type, the `Intialize` method returns a `MathematicalProgram`.
    
    return null( Algorithm, owning );
