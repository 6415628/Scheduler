StaticMethod GetStrategySetting_MaxPopulation (POAAlgorithm poaalgorithm, Number default_value) const as Number
{
  Description:
  [*
    The number of moves (plan possibilities of planelements) that make it in the final population.
    Moves that are estimated to be better have a higher chance to be in the population.
    All moves in the population are fully propagated, after which the best move is carried out.
    A higher number will mean more precise results because full propagation gives the precise score of a move.
    This comes at the cost of more time needed in propagation.
