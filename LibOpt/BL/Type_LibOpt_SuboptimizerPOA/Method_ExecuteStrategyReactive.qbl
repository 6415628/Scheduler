Method ExecuteStrategyReactive (stream[POAAlgorithm] poa) as stream[Void]
{
  Description:
  [*
    To be overridden. Call your POA strategy here.
    By defining the POA strategy in a static method without any references to your model, it will be executed asynchronously when called reactively.
    Make sure to encapsulate your static method with `LibOpt_SuboptimizerPOA::StrategyStart` and `LibOpt_SuboptimizerPOA::StrategyFinish` calls, just like is done in `LibOpt_SuboptimizerPOA::EmptyStrategy`
