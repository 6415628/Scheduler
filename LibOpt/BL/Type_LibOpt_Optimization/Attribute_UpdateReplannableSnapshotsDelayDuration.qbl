  Description:
  [*
    The snapshot of a quick dataset copy is created before the dataset copy creation method is called, because this method is called reactively.
    Therefore, `MDSEditor::Editor().ObjectInfos().Find( snapshot.DatasetName() )` will be null, when it is called between the creation of the snapshot and the reactive dataset copy call. 
    
    This attribute adds a small delay in the method `UpdateReplannableSnapshots` that prevents `MDSEditor::Editor().ObjectInfos().Find( snapshot.DatasetName() )` from being called too early.
    Note that the transaction priority of a dataset copy transaction is 'medium', while the transaction priority of most reactive methods within the optimizer is 'low'. 
    This implies that the the dataset copy creation transaction will typically be scheduled when the current transaction ends. So only a small delay is required.
