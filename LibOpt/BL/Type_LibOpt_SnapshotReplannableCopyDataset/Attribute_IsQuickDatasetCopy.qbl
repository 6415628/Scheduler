  Description:
  [*
    There are 2 ways to copy a dataset. A quick method and a slow and robust method.
    
    The quick method reactively creates a (standalone storage) dataset. This can be done in a separate transaction, which makes it faster than other dataset copy methods. 
    This quick method does not work during rollbacks or errors, because the reactive transaction would have to be rolled back.
    
    The slow and robust method creates a dataset in the same transaction. This means that the optimization process will have to wait until the dataset copy is finished.
    The storage state is first memory only, which gets changed to standalone storage in `LibOpt_DatasetCopyConditional::DoFinalizeDatasetCopyChangeToStandAlone`
