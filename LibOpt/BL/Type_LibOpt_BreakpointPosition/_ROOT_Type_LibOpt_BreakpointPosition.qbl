  Description:
  [*
    Note: The `LibOpt_BreakpointPosition` name is deprecated. This type will be renamed to `LibOpt_BreakpointPosition` in LibOpt 3.0. We cannot rename this type right now because of upgradability reasons. 
    All variables, comments and documentation are already refering to the new name. 
    
    The `LibOpt_BreakpointPosition` represents a specific point in time during the execution of a component.
    These component positions can be viewed in the 'Component positions' forms. 
    
    When a `LibOpt_DatasetCopyConditional` is attached to a `LibOpt_BreakpointPosition` then the `LibOpt_DatasetCopyConditional.CreateCondition` method is evaluated when the `LibOpt_Run` reaches that component position.
    When the `LibOpt_DatasetCopyConditional.CreateCondition` method returns `true`, then current dataset is copied. 
    Similarly, when a `LibOpt_BreakpointConditional` is attached to a `LibOpt_BreakpointPosition` and when the `LibOpt_BreakpointConditional.Condition` method returns `true`, then the run is paused at that component position. 
       
    The `LibOpt_Component.RegisterComponentPosition` method can be called to create a new `LibOpt_BreakpointPosition`.
