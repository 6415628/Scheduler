Method DeleteCondition (LibOpt_Task task) as Boolean
{
  Description:
  [*
    When this `LibOpt_DatasetCopyConditional` object creates a dataset, then this dataset can be conditionally deleted by `DeleteCondition` after all downstream components have finished executing. (A component can finish by throwing an error.)
    The dataset will be deleted when `DeleteCondition` returns `true`.
    When an error occurs during the execution of this method, then the dataset is not deleted. Also, the current iteration will fail if the run is executed in one transaction or if the optimizer is already handling another error. 
    In all other cases, the optimizer simply continues as if nothing happened.
