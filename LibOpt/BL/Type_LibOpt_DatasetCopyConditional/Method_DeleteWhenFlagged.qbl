Method DeleteWhenFlagged (Boolean isdatasetconstructed)
{
  Description:
  [*
    If the `LibOpt_SnapshotReplannableCopyDataset.HasExecutedDoFinalizeDatasetCopyDelete` attribute is `true` for a snapshot, then we know that we have executed the `LibOpt_DatasetCopyConditional::DoFinalizeDatasetCopyDelete` method for that snapshot.
    When `LibOpt_DatasetCopyConditional::DoFinalizeDatasetCopyDelete` has been executed for a snapshot, then we do not need the `this` object anymore for that snapshot.
    Therefore, if the `this` object is flagged for deletion and if `LibOpt_SnapshotReplannableCopyDataset.HasExecutedDoFinalizeDatasetCopyDelete` is `true` for all snapshots that have been created by the `this` object (so all snapshots in the `this.SnapshotReplannableCopyDataset` relation), 
    then we can safely delete `this`.
