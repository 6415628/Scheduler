  Description:
  [*
    The relation `LibOpt_Run` to `LibOpt_Optimizer` is purposely set to protected. The `LibOpt_Run` should never know how it was created. This way the run is completely independent of the optimizer that created it, meaning that it is easy to reuse all components of the run in another optimizer.
    Settings should be stored on the individual `LibOpt_Components`.
    
    If you need to get to your dataset type, you can use the `Optimization` method on `LibOpt_Run` or `LibOpt_Component`.
