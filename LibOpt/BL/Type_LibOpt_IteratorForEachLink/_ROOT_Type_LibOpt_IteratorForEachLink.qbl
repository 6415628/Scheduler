  Description:
  [*
    This iterator forks ingoing tasks to one per outgoing link.
    The outgoing links are sorted, and tasks are created in order of this sorting. At most `MaxParallel` tasks are run at the same time. All created tasks work on the incoming task's scope.
    
    There are two special cases worth pointing out:
    `MaxParallel` = 1 results in a sequencing behavior: a task for one link is only created once the task of the previous link has finished.
    `MaxParallel` >= #( outgoing links ) results in a parallelizer: each incoming task is instantly multiplied into one concurrent task per outgoing link.
