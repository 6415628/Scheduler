  BaseType: Object
  Description:
  [*
    A promise is an object that stores results of a calculation that is not finished. This means that as long as `IsFinished` equals `false`, the calculation is ongoing and there is no result.
    When this turns into `true`, the calculation is done and the results can be read.
    
    This object can be used client side; the client does not support reactive and we can use this object to get the results from a reactive chain to the client.
    The client should store the promise in a data holder and react on the change of the `IsFinished` attribute.
