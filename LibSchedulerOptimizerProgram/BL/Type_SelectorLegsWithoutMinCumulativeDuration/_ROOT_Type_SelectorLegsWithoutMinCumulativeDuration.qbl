  Description:
  [*
    Only selects legs that do not have the minimum cumulative duration. 
    We can freely swap operations between these legs without running into POA search inefficiencies.
    (If we select a leg without the requirement and one with,
     then POA will unplan 5 nodes from each and it will be forced to schedule the first 5 nodes on the path with a minimum cumulative duration, 
     which basically means that the search is only succesful if it happens to select the right 5 operations first
