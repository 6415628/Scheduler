        //And there is no way to fill a DetailPanel from another DetailPanel easily...

        //(2) Can't use a DataExtractor within a DetailPanel to extract from another DetailPanel too?!
        //So, add a DetailPanelSelectedXXXs that has the correct data type, and fill that DetailPanel here.
        //DetailPanelSelectedXXXs.Data().Remove( e.astype( XXX ) );
