Method GetCyclicGraphAsString (GraphProgramCycleDetection graphProgramCycleDetection) as String
{
  Description: 'Returns the cyclic graph as a string AFTER graph program circularity detection algorithm is executed.'
  TextBody:
  [*
    // Initialize cyclic graph for printing
    cyclicGraph := construct( Strings );
    
    // It is already a directed cyclic graph
    // The edges are already 'sorted' thus we can traverse through them to get to the correct 'next node'
    // We can also assume each node only has one edge, it is not a multibranching node with multiple edges resulting in multiple circularities
    traverse( graphProgramCycleDetection.Result().ReportCycle(), Edges, edge )
