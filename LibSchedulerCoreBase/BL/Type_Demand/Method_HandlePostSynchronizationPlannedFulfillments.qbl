  Description: 'Decides whether to adjusts planned fulfillment quantities and remove zero quantity fulfillments.'

    // MODELING HANDLE SC
    // Project team can adjust the behavior of quantity adjustment for planned (P) fulfillments after synchronizing fixed (F) fulfillments
    // It is only applicable to product based material reservation
    
    // EXAMPLE:
    // Currently the behavior is either to maintain the existing total reservation quantity between the same demand and supply
    // Before sync, P.Quantity = 5. After sync F.Quantity = 3, P.Quantity adjusted to 2, to maintain total quantity remains as 5
    
    fulfillment := this.GetPlannedFulfillmentBySupply( supply ) // Can't use Fulfillment.IsFixedReservation because it is not propagated after fixed fulfillment creation
    
    // Adjust the previous planned fulfillment that has the same supply after sync of external fulfilment of the same supply
    if( not isnull( fulfillment ) )
    {
      newQty := fulfillment.QuantityDecision() - fixedreservationquantity;
      fulfillment.UpdateQuantity( newQty ); // Quantity adjustment for planned fulfillments to prevent over reservation of supply after receiving fixed fulfillment
      
      if( fulfillment.QuantityDecision() <= 0 ) // if lesser or equal to 0, delete the planned fulfillment because fixed fulfillment quantity > than planned fulfillment quantity
      {
        fulfillment.Delete();
      }
