  Description:
  [*
    A task is, conceptually, a concretization of an OperationOnResource. The OOR links to its task if the respective operation is planned and is considered the "main" operation of the task. If the task is a batch task, it is up for the proejct to decide which operation to return by extending the BatchTask.GetOperation() method.
    
    This relation is used by the task to calculate timings like transfer durations.
