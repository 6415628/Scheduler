    // End is the concluded time of EstimatedEnd and EndReadIn.
    // Case 1: The default value will be estimated end time calculated from start time.
    // Case 2: When there is value reading in procedurally, this will be the value used as End.

    //         Note: For now it looks like End of FeedbackTaskInSF will always have value.
