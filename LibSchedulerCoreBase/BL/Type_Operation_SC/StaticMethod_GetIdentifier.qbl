    /*
    GetIdentifier received boolean argument to determine if additional info needs to be appended behind OperationID.
    Currently if received 'true' for appendMoreInfo, we add Task ID behind the Operation.
    But this can be customized. If more info had been returned through Operation::CalOperationID, additional info should be removed from this static method.
    
    Vice versaly, if more additional info needed, we should add them into this static method also.
