  Description:
  [*
    The depth of downstream nodes to be drawn, this will not exceed DownstreamDepthLimit, this can be calculated declaratively supposedly, 
    but we are doing this procedurally because we are using this attribute in shadow scope.
    
    Note: This attribute is ONLY used as shadow in the UI.
