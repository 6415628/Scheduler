Method GetBTSDeltaString () as String
{
  Description:
  [*
    Return the Excel formula which calculates the delta percentage when stored in the cell of column Delta in the BTS.
    The formula should be written such that it is independent of the row at which it is stored (can be done using the INDIRECT function in Excel).
    Example: 
    =IF( AND($L$4<>"",INDIRECT("L"&ROW())<>""),(INDIRECT("L"&ROW())-L$4)/ABS(L$4),"")
  *]
  TextBody: 'return \'=IF(AND(INDIRECT("M"&ROW())<>"",$M$4<>""),(IF($M$3="Max", -1, 1))*(INDIRECT("M"&ROW())-$M$4)/$K$4,"")\';'
}
