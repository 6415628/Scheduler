Method GetBTSImgDeltaString () as String
{
  Description:
  [*
    Return the Excel formula which calculates the delta image (green, yellow or red circle) when stored in the cell of the Delta image column in the BTS.
    The formula should be written such that it is independent of the row at which it is stored (can be done using the INDIRECT function in Excel).
    Example: 
    =IF(INDIRECT("M"&ROW())<>"",IF(INDIRECT("M"&ROW())>$M$4,3,IF($L$4>=0,IF(AND(INDIRECT("L"&ROW())<=(1+$C$8)*$L$4,INDIRECT("L"&ROW())>=(1-$C$8)*$L$4),2,INDIRECT("A"&ROW())),IF(AND(INDIRECT("L"&ROW())>=(1+$C$8)*$L$4,INDIRECT("L"&ROW())<=(1-$C$8)*$L$4),2,INDIRECT("A"&ROW())))),"")
