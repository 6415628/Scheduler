Method ExecuteExtensible (Key datasetKey_i, DMF_Dataset dataset_i, DMF_RunStep runStep_i) as stream[Void]
{
  Description:
  [*
    Extension point for end users to implement custom logic for topic steps
    Mind: There is a software bug/limitation with accessbility that requires this to be overridden so *Execute* can access it  
    when extension logic is made in an external scope. So we have to override this just to workaround the accessbility problem.

    // Implement your extension logic here.
    
    // It is very important to return stream[Void] in this method
    // because stream keeps the synchronosity and ensures 
    // methods called along the stream are executed before returning
