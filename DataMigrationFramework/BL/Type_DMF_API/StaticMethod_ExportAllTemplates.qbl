StaticMethod ExportAllTemplates () as stream[Void]
{
  Description:
  [*
    Used by the DMF UI to export all **core data schemas** detected after a **refresh datasets** action was performed. If there are none, it does nothing.  
    This action will always result in any existing exported core data schemas to be overridden for the current version of a core data definition. It is not encouraged to invoke this directly without the UI unless you know what you're doing.
