    For static methods, it's not possible to reliably use the ->| operator.
    This is because reactive quill will think the methods should be run
    in parallel if the argument of one static doesn't feed into the other.
    With normal methods, this is not the case, and such a chain works fine
    
    The full flow needs to Refresh, Prepare, then Execute
