Method SetPriorityAndDependentExtensible
{
  Description:
  [*
    Should contain any extension logic to control the prioritization and dependencies of how datasets should be upgraded.  
    It is not allowed to configure a dependency between two datasets that have different priorities, as this would not make sense.
  *]
  TextBody:
  [*
    // ToBeDecided: consider having this in DMF_API instead so all extensible are in one place
    //to be extended
    priorityHigh := DMF_DatasetType::PRIORITY_HIGH();
    priorityLow  := DMF_DatasetType::PRIORITY_LOW();
    
    //input dataset type and the priority, DMF will make use of the information during upgrade process, by default all dataset type is Medium priority
    //DMF_DatasetType::SetPriority( <datasetTypeCompany>, priorityHigh );
    //DMF_DatasetType::SetPriority( <datasetTypeCompany>, priorityLow );
    
    //Add dependent for the dataset 1 dataset type can have multiple dependent
    //DMF_DatasetType::AddDependent( <datasetTypeName>, <datasetTypeDependentName> );
    //DMF_DatasetType::AddDependent( <datasetTypeName>, <datasetTypeDependentName2> );
