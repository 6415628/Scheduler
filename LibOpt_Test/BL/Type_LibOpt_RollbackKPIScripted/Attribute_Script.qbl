  Description:
  [*
    The script this RollbackKPI will follow.
    It contains the `RealVectors` it will return. Each time the `GetKPI` method is called a part of the script is returned.
    Each time one of the suboptimizers defined in `LibOpt_Test` calls the `HandleResult` method, the next part will be returned.
    
    For example, if:
     - NrOfLevels = 2
     - Script = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0]
    
    The NrOfLevels is the amount of KPI levels we have. That means the amount of entries in the RealVector we will return every time GetKPI is called. Since our NrOfLevels = 2, we will return 2 values every time.
    If Index = 0, GetKPI will return [1.0, 2.0].
    If Index = 1, GetKPI will return [3.0, 4.0]
    If Index = 2, GetKPI will return [5.0, 6.0]
    If Index = 3, GetKPI will return [7.0, 8.0]
    If Index > 3, GetKPI will error, as there is no set of 2 reals after [7.0, 8.0].
    
    As mentioned. The Index is updated each time we enter the `HandleResult` method in the suboptimizers defined in `LibOpt_Test`.
