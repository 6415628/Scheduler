StaticMethod EnsureExist (SuboptimizerMRSPOA owner, Operation_SCs operations) as owning OperationInSuboptimizers
{
  Description:
  [*
    Like ::FindOrCreate, but works on multiple operations: For each operation in the given set, checks whether an OperationInSuboptimizer object exists linking it to the given suboptimizer, and if not, creates it.
    Returns the so-ensured set of OperationInSuboptimizers.
    Runtime complexity linear in the size of the input.
