  Description:
  [*
    This component decides on and executes a modeled rollback OnFinalize (!). It looks at the current plan and at all snapshots in consideration. If any of the snapshots have a better rollback KPI than the current plan, then the best snapshot is rolled back to.
    This is an abstract supertype for modeled rolblacks. Extending subtypes are expected to override GetSnapshots.
    
    Changes the plan and owns a RollbackKPI, so its snapshots will be shown out-of-the-box in the components views. (We can give it its own color and image icon by overriding methods.)
