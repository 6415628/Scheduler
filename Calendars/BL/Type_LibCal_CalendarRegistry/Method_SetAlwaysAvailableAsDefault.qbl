Method SetAlwaysAvailableAsDefault () as LibCal_CalendarRegistry
{
  Description:
  [*
    Set event "Always available" as default, which means that all new calendars will automatically subscribe to it.
    Note that this is discouraged; the calendars should ideally start closed, i.e. with no capacity available, and events should be used explicitly to make capacity available.
  *]
  TextBody:
  [*
    event := guard( this.CommonCalendar().GetEvent( LibCal_Event::ALWAYS_AVAILABLE() ), null( LibCal_Event ) );
    
    if( not isnull( event ) )
    {
      event.SetIsDefault( true );
