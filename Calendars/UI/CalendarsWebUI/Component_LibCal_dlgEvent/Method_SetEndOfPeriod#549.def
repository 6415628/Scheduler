  Body:
  [*
    // When this method is called from response dtStartOfPeriod.OnChanged() because the value is set during
    // InitializeRecurrencePeriod(), the value of ckbEndOfPeriod.Checked() is *always* 'false', even when it is
    // explicitly set to 'true' during the initialization. This seems to be a bug in the Software.
    // As a workaround, the value of lblWorkaround.Text() is set to "initialized" when the value of ckbEndOfPeriod.Checked() is set.
    // When this method is called during initialization, the value of the label is still "" (which is WRONG, it should have been set!).
    // This can be used to let this method not be executed with a value of ckbEndOfPeriod.Checked() that is not
    // properly initialized.
